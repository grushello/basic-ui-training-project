## Animal Images

The project supports local image files from static resources.

- Add custom animal photos to `src/main/resources/static/images/animals/`
- Store only the filename in the animal field, for example `Luna.jpeg`
- The app resolves that value to `/images/animals/Luna.jpeg`

If image filename/url is missing, a fallback is selected by animal type:

- CAT -> `/images/fallback/fallback-cat.jpg`
- DOG -> `/images/fallback/fallback-dog.jpg`
- OTHER -> `/images/fallback/fallback-other.jpg`

Place fallback files in `src/main/resources/static/images/fallback/`.
